                    <h1 class="blog-title bottom_30 top_30">Breaking into Tech: This Is My New Beginning</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>It has been almost 8 months since I set out on this journey to find myself a new beginning. I started over, I left my business behind to start anew and to become stable once again.  The goal was to break into tech. Before this journey, I was the owner of a Photobooth rental company for 5 years after leaving the Chicago Board of Elections to pursue an entrepreneurial career and gain the freedom of owning my business. Back at the beginning of 2020, my business had started to slow down and by March we were hit with a pandemic that had shut everything down including my business.
                    </p> <br> 
                    <p>After the COVID-19 shutdown, I was out of a job and needed to find a way to make money and a new path in life. So the question came: what's next for me? Where will I go or what will I do next? Over the past year, I had seen how there is a shortage of tech staff and that you can go to a boot camp and learn all the skills needed to enter the field. At this point, I didn’t know where to start or go. Luckily a few months later my best friend was telling me about a program that he was applying to called i.c.stars rooted in technology and leadership skills. So I decided to join him in applying for the internship. 
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>With a background in architecture and design, I had no technology experience, I was 1 of 17 chosen from 100’s of applicants in Chicago, and of that only 9 of us were resilient enough to make it through. While at i.c.stars I gain a deep understanding of myself, I was thought a wide variety of skills in the tech field, from front end to back end development, robotic process automation, and leadership skills. The one important skill set that I think that i.c.stars teaches is that we can overcome any obstacle put in front of us, an ability to be quick-witted, and learning fast is the key to unlocking our full potential in tech. You can find the founder and CEO chanting “Born Ready” one of the many mottos that stood out to me from this wisdom-filled pioneer. That is Sandee. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    After commencing at i.c.stars I wasn’t sure what lied ahead of me, I doubted that I would even get a job in tech, I wondered did i.c.stars teach me enough skills to be successful in the field. But what I had told myself was that if I was going to go back to working in corporate  I wanted to work hybrid and, I wanted to join a company that has an amazing forward-thinking culture.</p>
                    <br><p>I began interviewing at different companies that i.c.stars had connections with, I went to networking events and pitched to VP’S why they should hire me and give me a chance for interviews. But I will tell you it was draining putting in all this work and energy into interviews then having to play the waiting game. While still applying to a job and promoting yourself every chance I got. Getting the news of my first interview and that I didn’t get it had me down but I was determined I knew that the right fit would come along. </p>
                   <br>
                    <p>Just a month ago I was finally hired by Nansen. I was most definitely nervous thinking about would I like it here, how was the culture and were people approachable and genuine. all that was put at ease after having lunch with a few of my new colleagues. Everyone welcomed me with open arms, the front-end team has pushed me every day to learn and grow. I believe this is a wonderful opportunity to be a part of the innovative company that is Nansen. I have seen that Nansen is pushing boundaries, forward-thinking, and creating adventures every day. It truly feels like a family here and the my growth journey is endless. </p>
